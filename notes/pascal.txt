RelativeURI = <URI>			GET index.html HTTP/1.1
AbsoluteURI = <host>:<uri>	GET example:index.html HTTP/1.1

Section 9:
	The Host request-header field (section 14.23) MUST accompany all
	HTTP/1.1 requests.

1. If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the
	Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be
	ignored.

2. If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes
	a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header
	field value.

3. If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on
	the server, the response MUST be a 400 (Bad Request) error message.



RFC: Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2396
	The URI syntax is dependent upon the scheme. In general, absolute
	URI are written as follows:
		<scheme>:<scheme-specific-part>


If an origin server receives a request that does not include an
Expect request-header field with the "100-continue" expectation,
the request includes a request body, and the server responds
with a final status code before reading the entire request body
from the transport connection, then the server SHOULD NOT close
the transport connection until it has read the entire request,
or until the client closes the connection. Otherwise, the client
might not reliably receive the response message. However, this
requirement is not be construed as preventing a server from
defending itself against denial-of-service attacks, or from
badly broken client implementations.
