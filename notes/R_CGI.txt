Input from a form is seperated by an & ex. "val1=5&val2=66"

Input needs to be seperated, first on "&" and then on "="

How, do you get to the URI data from within your program? You read it from the environment variable QUERY_STRING.

curl "127.0.0.1:8080/cgi-bin/add.py?num1=5&num2=65" -v

CGI Blueprint:

open pipes                                 
create Fork                                 
execute cgi script > open pipe                  < read input from pipe into webserv
												send data read from pipe as response
close pipes



->	CGI(Request object)
->	addPollfd & removePollfd
->  request(Host already determined that it's CGI, via routing)
->	request body contains the QUERY_STRING to be exported
->	create vector of strings to be converted to the char*env[]
->	execve cgi script
