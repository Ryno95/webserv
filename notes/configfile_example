Sections start with the name of the section: [universal] [server] [host]
Then followed by curly brackets, describing what belongs to this section.

Variable fields are declared with an identifier (i.e. listen_port) and then a (or more if applicable) value(s),
seperated by (at least one) whitespace (' ' or '\t' or '\n') and ended by a ';'

Examples of valid configurations:
	listen_port 80;
	buffer_size 1024;
	methods GET POST;
	name domain1.com domain1.nl
		domain1.net;



EXAMPLE structure:

universal
{
	// fields applying to all servers
}

server
{
	listen_port
	mime_config_file
	? [cgi_config_file] do we need this?
	? [backlog_amount] here or universal variable?
	? [buffer_size] here or universal variable?

	host
	{
		name [unique_name] [unique_name] ...
		root [path]
		methods [GET] [POST] [DELETE]
		default_index_file [path]
		default_error_file [path]
		? do we want [location] config to search for the necessary host?
	}

	host
	{
		...
	}
	...
}

server
{
	...
}
...
